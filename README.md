# Nest Cortex Prototype

Nest Cortex is a personal initiative led by [Jimi Ige](https://github.com/Jimi-Ige), designed to build a scalable, data-driven platform for trauma-informed care and wraparound services for mission-driven organizations. The goal is to empower mission-driven organizations with tools to track outcomes, generate insights, and improve decision-making. This repository reflects the prototype phase, which focuses on:
- Validating the technical feasibility of the platform.
- Exploring data-driven solutions for improving housing stability and program impact.
- Establishing a foundation for future development and collaboration.

### Features
- **Participant Data Tracking**: Azure Data Lake setup is used to store intake forms and session logs.
- **AI Insights**: Simple trend analysis for program planning.
- **Donor Dashboards**: Power BI visualizations of program metrics.

### Current Development Goals
1. Deploy Azure Data Lake for data storage.
2. Build Power BI dashboards for housing program outcomes.
3. Integrate basic AI models to analyze program trends.
